                                    I started learning CS during the second-year of my undergrad, initialy focused on PHP based web-applicatons.<br><br>
                                    In my third-year, I joined Perfect Skills as a PHP developer intern, and revamped the existing web-app UI and backend processes.<br><br>
                                    Later that year I lead the migration of the same web-app from PHP to Vue.JS/Django microservices architecture.<br><br>
                                    In my final year I worked with Xoriant on Angular based web-applications. During this time I fell in love with project management
                                    and since I am upskilling and learning about the discipline.
